PivotalMarkdown is a gem to facilitate posting stories to PivotalTracker.

I was writing all of the stories for my team, and I found it was easiest for me to compose them in Markdown prior to posting them. This gem is intended to take Markdown files in the format I used, parse them into stories and epics, and add them to a PT project.

PivotalMarkdown was meant to be an expansion of the `pivotal-uploader` ([here](https://github.com/philliplongman/pivotal-uploader)) script I wrote at Launch Academy's Ship It Saturday hackathon. But since I am no longer writing stories for that team, I have stopped developing the gem for now.

Currently it only handles setting your API token and a default project in a `.pivotal_markdown` file.

## Usage

```
Commands:
  ptmd help [COMMAND]          # Describe available commands or one specific command
  ptmd project COMMAND         # Configure project to default to when none is specified
  ptmd token COMMAND           # Configure API token to access Pivotal Tracker

  ptmd project check           # Check configured default project
  ptmd project help [COMMAND]  # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
  ptmd project reset           # Clear configured API token
  ptmd project set PROJECT_ID  # Set default project

  ptmd token check             # Check configured API token
  ptmd token help [COMMAND]    # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
  ptmd token set TOKEN         # Set API token to access
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
