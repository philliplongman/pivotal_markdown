# Example feature (feature)

As a product manager,
I want to write user stories in markdown and upload them to Pivotal Tracker,
so that I can do less work setting them up.

Notes:
* Asterisk bullet points should be considered part of the description.

Labels: example feature, pretend label

- Every # header should begin a new story.
- Story type should be at the end of the story name. Default is feature.
- Labels should be prefixed by 'Labels:' and be comma-separated.
- Tasks should appear at the end as a hyphen bullet point.


# Example feature II

As a story writer,
I don't want stories to default to feature if I don't specify a type,
so that I don't have to.


# Example bug (bug)

This is a bug. Something is wrong with the example feature. This story has a label.

Labels: example feature


# Example chore (chore)

This is a chore and isn't written with all those bells and whistles.
